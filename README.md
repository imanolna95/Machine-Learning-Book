This book serves as a resource for anyone looking to learn about Machine Learning, one of the most relevant sectors in science and technology. The book will have the following structure: a first chapter in which I will introduce several concepts of importance in this field (training and testing splits, bias-variance tradeoff, normalization, cross-validation, and supervised and unsupervised models) that I will resort to throughout the book. Then, a few chapters in which I will work on 20 of the most relevant algorithms in Machine Learning (from linear regressions to complex neural networks). Each algorithm section will include a thorough mathematical development of the equations involved, my implementation in Python, and the application of these models to databases, which will include plots displaying the results of these algorithms. I must mention that my background as a Theoretical Physicist has made me very demanding with mathematical rigor. So, if you are looking for a book where every single step of the mathematical background of the algorithms is explained clearly, this is your book. You will learn how to build algorithms for things as cool as image recognition. The algorithms that will be at your disposal are the following:

* **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**

* **Ridge Algorithm**

* **LASSO regression**

* **Elastic-net**

* **Adaptive Regression Through Hinges**

* **Locally weighted Linear Regression (polynomial)**

* **Bayesian linear regression**

* **Apriori algorithm**

* **Logistic regression**

* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

* **Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)**

* **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

* **K-Means Clustering**

* **Principal Component Analysis (dimesionality reduction)**

* **Regression and Classification Trees (CART)**

* **Random Forest**

* **Gradient Boosted classification trees**

* **Eigenfaces (implemented for image recognition)**

* **Regular Neural Network (implemented for image recognition)**

* **Convolutional Neural Network (implemented for image recognition)**
